This repository relates to Sportioum.

The goal of Sportioum is to allow users to support sports people financially. 
This includes purchasing NFT's as well as a monthly subscription in return for perks. 

The project is made in Unity. It is a 2D application that targets the android platform initially but can later be deployed to IOS as well as WebGL.

Only the Assets folder is committed here for convenience of review. 

To run the project:

-Create an empty unity project.
-Close Unity and then paste the assets folder into your project, replacing the assets folder that is there. 
-Click play at the top of the editor. 
-You can now navigate the app. Start by clicking the 'I'm a fan' button and signing up.
-You can connect your MetaMask wallet on the AthleteProfilePage_Fan

Within the assets folder is all of the main project scripts and folders. 

The actual UI is built within the editor of Unity so cannot be viewed here so a screenshots file is uploaded separately.

The project scripts can be found within the 'scripts' folder.

Most of the scripts relate to the function of the UI but the basis of a wallet integration can be viewed in the script entitled 'walletManagerScript'.

The application has the basis of an integration with MetaMask.
